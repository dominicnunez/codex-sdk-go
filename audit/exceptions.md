## False Positives

<!-- Findings where the audit misread the code or described behavior that doesn't occur -->

## Won't Fix

<!-- Real findings not worth fixing — architectural cost, external constraints, etc. -->

### StdioTransport.Close does not stop the reader goroutine

**Location:** `stdio.go:140-157` — Close() and readLoop()
**Date:** 2026-02-26

**Reason:** Fixing this requires changing the public API from `io.Reader` to `io.ReadCloser`,
which is a breaking change for all callers. The primary use case is `os.Stdin`, where the reader
goroutine terminates naturally with the process. In library contexts, callers control the underlying
reader and can close it themselves to unblock the scanner. The goroutine leak only matters for
long-running processes that create and discard many StdioTransport instances — a usage pattern
this SDK doesn't target.

## Intentional Design Decisions

<!-- Findings that describe behavior which is correct by design -->
